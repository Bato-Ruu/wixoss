#Each todo item will be separated by one line while subsequent related ideas and the description of the issue will be 
#   posted in the line after with indentations

#IMPORTANT:
  When completed a todo item, please move it to the Completed section at the bottom and write a small description on how it was done

Final Product:
  
  How to give out executable?
    ship out dlls with the .exe? or other proposals?

Database:

  Issues:
    Some cards have "image not found"
      might be caused by an extra "\"
    Some cards which has effect/text doesn't get displayed/query'd correctly
      possibly caused by them not having on-play/constant/action in front of the effect description

  Recorded proposal for change:
    Have more separation
      Make the database record the ids of effects a card contains and handle them outside of the database
              ----Creec
    
    Maybe have a simple "scripting interface" to make implementation of effects faster and allow new cards to be added more easily
        -klaxa
    
    Documentation on format used by the database
      right now it is just 0,1,2, very unfriendly for first time readers
    
Miscellaneous:

  Custom program for inserting new cards according to decided database format
    Instead of writing to the .txt and converting and modifying each time, we can have a program that prompts for the required information and giving warnings for missing or invalid fields, it can also be designed to give a more visual understanding and easier control of the database

      Why not just convert it to a CSV format or other easily-parsed table?
        --Lily
        
  Handling of effects(on the card)

  Decide on location of database initialization
    right now there is local database declarations within the card constructor causing this message:
      "QSqlDatabasePrivate::addDatabase: duplicate connection name 'qt_sql_default_connection', old connection removed."
    proposal:
      we can change it to a global / static global since the card database wouldn't change in the middle of the software running
    
    
  Ener Zone Display showing available Ener (XR, YC, etc) with Multi-Ener represented as it's own pool. Include preference option to display total.
  
  
  Minimize many of the zones to hover-to-zoom and similar, to allow for better arrangement of GUI elements without sacrificing functionality
