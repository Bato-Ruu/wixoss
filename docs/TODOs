Final Product:
  
  How to give out executable?
    ship out dlls with the .exe? or other proposals?

Database:

  Recorded proposal for change:
    Have more separation
      Make the database record the ids of effects a card contains and handle them outside of the database
              ----Creec
    
    Maybe have a simple "scripting interface" to make implementation of effects faster and allow new cards to be added more easily
        -klaxa
    
    Documentation on format used by the database
      right now it is just 0,1,2, very unfriendly for first time readers
    
Miscellaneous:

  Custom program for inserting new cards according to decided database format
    Instead of writing to the .txt and converting and modifying each time, we can have a program that prompts for the required information and giving warnings for missing or invalid fields, it can also be designed to give a more visual understanding and easier control of the database

  Handling of effects(on the card)

  Decide on location of database initialization
    right now there is local database declarations within the card constructor causing this message:
      "QSqlDatabasePrivate::addDatabase: duplicate connection name 'qt_sql_default_connection', old connection removed."
    proposal:
      we can change it to a global / static global since the card database wouldn't change in the middle of the software running
